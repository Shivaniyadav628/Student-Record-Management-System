 Student Record Management System
 
A Python-based console application designed to efficiently manage student records using a menu-driven interface. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts, data handling, and problem-solving skills essential for software engineering internships like Google STEP.

Project Overview

The "Student Record Management System" helps manage student data such as name, roll number, and marks. It supports multiple operations including adding, updating, deleting, searching, and analyzing student records. Data persistence is handled using CSV file storage.

 Features(Operations Performed)

 CRUD Operations
 
  Add new student records  
  Delete student records  
  Search students by roll number  
  Display all students  
  
  Data Processing & Analytics Operations
  
  Calculate average marks  
  Identify the top-performing student  
  sorted student records based on marks(descending order)  
  Filter Records
 

  File Handling Operations
  
  Store data using CSV file handling 
  Data parsing

  User Interaction Operations
  
  Menu-driven console interface  
  Input Validation(Basic)
  
  Technologies Used
  
- Language: "Python" 
- "Concepts Applied:"
  - Functions  
  - Lists and Dictionaries
